# DIIN

DIIN is an app to Android Platform dedicated to controlling 
the daily expenses. 
The app provides a simple user interface 
to check debts by month.

Besides that, I guess that the DIIN project is a good way 
for me to use new libraries and resources to improve my 
skills in Android development.
